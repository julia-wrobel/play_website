I'm using this repo to learn more advanced git commands, using advice from the following tutorials:

1.  [*Learn Enoughâ„¢ Git to Be
     Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial)

1. [Jenny Bryan's Git course](http://happygitwithr.com/)


The first link is a nice beginners guide and the second gives more details about how git actually works.
